# Datasets
This folder contains the Google Drive (GDrive) links for the preapred datasets used in this experiment. Since the datasets size is huge, they were not uploaded directly into the repository. These Links can be used in Jupyter Notebooks to directly download the datasets in the directory, or can be downloaded manually to a local/virtual drive. Train dataset is around 7.86 GB while Test dataset is around 2.83 GB. More details about the datasets can be found in the relevant paper. Dataset files are in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) format.
