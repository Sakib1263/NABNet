# Datasets
This folder contains the Google Drive (GDrive) links for the prepared datasets used in this experiment. Since the datasets size is huge, they were not uploaded directly into the repository. These Links can be used in Jupyter Notebooks to directly download the datasets in the directory, or can be downloaded manually to a local/virtual drive. More details about the datasets can be found in the relevant paper. Dataset files are in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) format which needs to be dealt witha HDF5 library. Four preprocessed datasets have been created from four parts in the "The Cuff-Less Blood Pressure Estimation dataset". For each fold, three of them were used for training and one for test.
