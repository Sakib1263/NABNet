# Deep Learning Pipeline to Construct the UNet based Autoencoder (along with options such as Deep Supervision)
The follower can configure the structure of the network in the Configurations section of the Pipeline. The UNet code is provided as a Python (.py) file which is imported to the pipeline. The UNet code has been developed with flexibility so that the user can build the network just manipulating the configuration parameters.
