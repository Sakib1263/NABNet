## Deep Learning based end-to-end Pipeline forBP Prediction and ABP Estimation
The follower can configure the structure of the network in the Configurations section of the Pipeline. The UNet code is provided as a Python (.py) file which is imported to the pipeline. The UNet code has been developed with flexibility so that the user can build the network just manipulating the configuration parameters.
